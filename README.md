The design was entirely coded on a platform known as Monschool. The design mainly consists of various structures created by using circles, ellipses, and triangles. These basic shapes were used to create flowers and rings of the design. For implementing this, the functions Circle(), Ellipse(), and Polygon() were used.Starting from the outermost ring, the design was created inwards, creating multiple layers combining shapes to create complex structures and colouring and positioning them appropriately.
